## Testing your contributions

To build and run all test cases open XCStrings Tool with Xcode and hit âŒ˜U (command + U).

### Snapshot tests in XCStrings Tool

The majority of tests for XCStrings Tool are implemented using snapshot tests. Snapshot tests compare a "snapshot" of the output generated by a previous version of the software with the output generated by a subsequent version. The test is passed if the outputs are the same.  

Snapshot testing is handled by the [GenerateTests](https://github.com/liamnichols/xcstrings-tool/blob/main/Tests/XCStringsToolTests/GenerateTests.swift) class. When the snapshot tests are run, XCStrings Tool generates Swift code using the .xcstrings files in the [__Fixtures__](https://github.com/liamnichols/xcstrings-tool/tree/main/Tests/XCStringsToolTests/__Fixtures__) directory. These files are then compared to the snapshots in the [GenerateTests](https://github.com/liamnichols/xcstrings-tool/tree/main/Tests/XCStringsToolTests/__Snapshots__/GenerateTests) directory.

### Dealing with failed snapshot tests

If there is a discrepancy between a generated Swift file and its corresponding snapshot, the relevant snapshot test will fail. This means that either:

* A bug has been introduced; or

* The changes that have been made are expected to generate a new Swift file. In this case the relevant snapshot file in [GenerateTests](https://github.com/liamnichols/xcstrings-tool/tree/main/Tests/XCStringsToolTests/__Snapshots__/GenerateTests) must be updated.

### Viewing the generated Swift files

If you want to view the Swift files generated by the snapshot tests:

1. Comment out the following line in the trailing closure taken by `addTearDownBlock` in [GenerateTests.swift](https://github.com/liamnichols/xcstrings-tool/blob/main/Tests/XCStringsToolTests/GenerateTests.swift):

```

//try? fileManager.removeItem(at: outputURL)

```

2.  Rerun the tests using command + U in Xcode.

This will prevent the generated Swift files from being removed after the tests are run. The filepath for these files will be printed in the console.

**N.B.** by commenting out this line you will be generating potentially unwanted Swift files every time you run the snapshot tests.
